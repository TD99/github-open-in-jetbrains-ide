    <h3>1. Supported IDEs</h3>
    <p>All major JetBrains IDEs are supported, including IntelliJ IDEA, PyCharm, WebStorm, PhpStorm, CLion, GoLand,
        Rider, RubyMine, DataGrip, and DataSpell.</p>

    <h3>2. Using the extension on GitHub</h3>
    <p>On a GitHub repository page, open the Code dropdown menu.</p>
    <p class="unstyled">You’ll see a new button:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>"Open with &lt;IDE&gt;": opens the repository directly.</li>
        <li>"▼"-button: lets you pick another IDE.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>3. Default IDE</h3>
    <p>The IDE you pick from the "▼"-menu becomes your new default. The extension remembers your choice.</p>

    <h3>4. Toolbox Behavior</h3>
    <p>
        If a repository was already cloned in a JetBrains IDE, that IDE will be used automatically
        (instead of the default set in the extension).
        This is JetBrains Toolbox’s intended behavior and can be useful to automatically locate the repo clone on your
        device.
